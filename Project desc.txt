Spring framework is one of the most popular frameworks in the Java world which used to develop Java application,
 both core Java, and web application. It is also one of the most job oriented skill for Java developer, 
hence many beginners and intermediate Java programmers try to learn Spring framework by their own. Though
 there are some good Spring training courses available online, books are still the most popular and preferred
 way to learn Spring frameworks like Spring core, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Batch or Spring Security.  
I often receive queries for Spring book recommendations e.g. which Spring book is good for beginners, or which
 Spring book is good for intermediate and advanced developers, which book should I read to learn Spring boot, 
Spring Cloud, Spring Batch or Spring security etc?
